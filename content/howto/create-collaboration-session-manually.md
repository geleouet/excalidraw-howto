title: Create a collaboration session manually
---

In order to create a session manually you just need to generate a link of this form:

```
https://excalidraw.com/#room=[0-9a-f]{20},[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{22}
```

#### Example

```
https://excalidraw.com/#room=91bd46ae3aa84dff9d20,pfLqgEoY1c2ioq8LmGwsFA
```

The first set of digits is the room. This is visible from the server that's going to dispatch messages to everyone that knows this number.

The second set of digits is the encryption key. The Excalidraw server doesn't know about it. This is what all the participants use to encrypt/decrypt the messages.
